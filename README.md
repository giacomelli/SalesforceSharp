Usage

Authenticating
---
```csharp
var client = new SalesforceClient();
var authFlow = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFlow(clientId, clientSecret, username, password);

try 
{
	client.Authenticate(authFlow);
}
catch(SalesforceException ex)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Authentication failed: {0} : {1}", ex.Error, ex.Message);
}
```

Querying records
---
```csharp

public class Account
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}

....

var records = client.Query<Account>("SELECT id, name, description FROM Account");

foreach(var r in records)
{
	Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", r.Id, r.Name);
}
```

Finding a record by Id
---

```csharp

var record = client.FindById<Account>("Account", "<ID>");
```

Creating a record
---
```csharp

// Using a class. 
client.Create("Account", new Account() 
{ Name = "name created", Description = "description created" }));

// Using an anonymous.
client.Create("Account", new { Name = "name created", Description = "description created" }));
```

Updating a record
---
```csharp

// Using a class. Ever required property should be set.
client.Update("Account", "<record id>", new Account() 
{ Name = "name updated", Description = "description updated" }));

// Using an anonymous. Only required properties will be updated.
client.Update("Account", "<record id>", new { Description = "description updated" }));

Roadmap

 	-  User-agent flow, used by applications that cannot securely store the consumer secret.
